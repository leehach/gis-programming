# Overview

## Course Description

Building on previous coursework with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), students will learn computer programming in a GIS environment. Students will design and execute spatial data management and spatial analysis projects using automated geoprocessing functions available in the built-in scripting languages of prominent GIS software packages, with an emphasis on the Python programming language. Students will learn programming concepts such as variable typing, function definition, conditional evaluation, looping, and object-oriented programming. The course will also introduce geospatial programming strategies independent of any specific GIS software.

Python has rapidly become the *de facto* standard for scientific computing. It is also the scripting language used by two prominent GIS packages, ArcGIS (proprietary) and QGIS (open source). There is also an extensive and growing ecosystem of Python packages for geospatial analysis. The course will begin by focusing on using Python and ArcPy for ArcGIS scripting and automation, while also introducing fundamental concepts in programming, using the textbook *Python for ArcGIS*. We will also make use of [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) interactive tutorials to learn Python syntax and reinforce these fundamental concepts. This part of the course will feature weekly exercises and quizzes on these basic concepts.

The latter part of the course will introduce Python geospatial programming outside of the ArcGIS environment. In this part of the course, students will present tutorials on further topics in Python and ArcPy.

## Prerequisites

* Fundamentals of GIS (GUS 5062) with B- or better, or equivalent
* A laptop on which you can install software and data

## Assignments in Brief

You will earn points along several **tracks**. Each track is worth up to 100 points. Your must progress along ***ALL*** tracks to be successful in this course. Your final grade is based on the ***lowest*** score earned along any track.

The tracks and points associated with each assignment in the track are as follows:

Attendance
: 0-100 points. Your attendance score is a straight percentage of the class sessions you are present for.

Programming Quizzes (8)
: 34 base score.
: 10 points each for quizzes 1 through 5.
: 3 points each for quizzes 6 through 8.
: Exercises (6): 1 bonus point each (6 max).

DataCamp (4)
: 60 base score
: 10 points each course completed fully

Programming Assignments (3)
: 69 base score
: 10 points Assignment 1
: 10 points Assignment 2
: 10 points Assignment 3

Student-Led Tutorial
: 70-100 points. The tutorial is a skills workshop developed and presented by teams of 3-4 students based on topics discussed in class. The tutorial is awarded up to 30 points based on written materials (a workbook) and presentation.
